# tic-tac-toe
This tic-tac-toe game was written in Ruby and uses a class 'Game' with methods for game logic. Users are prompted to enter their names and then prompted to in turn enter coordinates to select where to place their marker in the grid. If invalid coordinates are entered, the user is prompted to re-enter valid ones. The game announces a winner as soon as there are 3 in a row, or ends with a tie when the grid is full.
